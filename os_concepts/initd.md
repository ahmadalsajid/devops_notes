### init.d
location `/etc/init.d`

Most Linux distributions includes scripts in `/etc/init.d` directory, which 
are started during the boot process (or executed when you shutdown or reboot 
the system). For instance on Redhat or CentOS Linux, the `/etc/init.d/httpd` 
script runs at boot time, and starts Apache daemons.
